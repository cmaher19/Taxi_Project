All of the data necessary for making our files work is uploaded to the repo. Therefore, you should get it all when you pull.

We have added a shinyreport.Rmd file that can knit our report into a PDF if you'd like it that way. BUT we think the best way to look at our project is to run through the app.R file. This file should work by clicking 'Run App' (but we think its best to go line by line to look at visualizations and models). This file is much more extensive in the fact that it runs all of our plots (be sure to look at them using zoom since they are funky otherwise) and it runs the Shiny App (the main reason for doing this projet). Simply running this file should give reproducible results for our project. Your working directory should be set to wherever pulling from the repo placed the files. This will allow the app.R file to run without issue.

NOTE: The app.R file contains all of the writing from our technical report, so you essentially don't need the .Rmd file at all.
